## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Industry Challenges in East African Construction

The construction industry in East Africa faces several critical challenges:

1. **Communication Gaps**: Poor communication between site workers, project managers, and stakeholders leads to delays and misunderstandings
2. **Limited Digital Adoption**: Most construction companies still rely on paper-based processes and manual tracking systems
3. **Connectivity Issues**: Construction sites often have unreliable or no internet connectivity, making cloud-based solutions impractical
4. **Safety Concerns**: Inadequate safety monitoring and incident reporting systems lead to workplace accidents
5. **Resource Mismanagement**: Lack of real-time visibility into project progress, resource allocation, and budget utilization
6. **Project Delays**: Poor coordination and monitoring result in significant project delays and cost overruns

### 1.2 Market Need

According to industry reports, the East African construction market is projected to grow at 6.2% CAGR through 2028. However, project efficiency remains low due to the aforementioned challenges. There is a clear need for a localized, robust construction management solution that can operate reliably in challenging connectivity environments.
