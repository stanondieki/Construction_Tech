# Dashboard Login Issue - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description
The dashboard was crashing or closing after login, preventing users from accessing the main application interface.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Header Format
**Problem**: Frontend was using `Bearer` token format, but Django backend expected `JWT` format.
**Fix**: Updated both API clients to use `JWT ${token}` instead of `Bearer ${token}`.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/api/client.ts` - Line 60: Changed `Bearer` to `JWT`
- `src/lib/api/api.ts` - Line 152: Already had `JWT` format (correct)

### 2. Missing Authentication API
**Problem**: AuthContext was importing `authAPI` from old api.ts file, but the function didn't exist.
**Fix**: Added complete `authAPI` object to the old api.ts file for backward compatibility.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/api/api.ts` - Added authAPI export with correct endpoints
- `src/lib/api/services.ts` - Fixed login function parameter type (username → email)

### 3. Incorrect Login Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to call `/api/auth/login/` but the correct Django endpoint is `/api/auth/jwt/create/`.
**Fix**: Updated all authentication calls to use the correct JWT endpoints.

### 4. TypeScript Errors
**Problem**: Dashboard had multiple TypeScript compilation errors preventing proper execution.
**Fix**: Fixed all type errors in dashboard components.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Added Task type and fixed state typing
- `src/app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx` - Added Task type and fixed state typing  
- `src/app/system-status/page.tsx` - Fixed register function check
- Removed corrupted `page_backup.tsx` file

### 5. Sample Data Command Issues
**Problem**: The sample data creation command had errors with notification model fields.
**Fix**: Fixed the notification creation to use correct field names and values.

**Files Modified**:
- `projects/management/commands/create_sample_data.py` - Removed invalid `priority` field from notifications

### 6. User Data Association
**Problem**: The admin user had no associated projects or tasks to display, causing empty dashboard.
**Fix**: Associated admin user with sample projects and tasks.

**Database Changes**:
- Added admin user as team member to 2 projects
- Added admin user as assignee to 3 tasks
- Set admin user password to 'admin123'

## Test Credentials
- **Email**: admin@ujenziiq.com
- **Password**: admin123

## API Endpoints Verified Working
- ✅ `/api/auth/jwt/create/` - Login
- ✅ `/api/auth/users/me/` - User profile
- ✅ `/api/projects/my_projects/` - User's projects
- ✅ `/api/tasks/my_tasks/` - User's tasks
- ✅ `/api/safety/` - Safety incidents

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User can log in with admin@ujenziiq.com / admin123
2. Login redirects to /dashboard 
3. Dashboard loads without crashing
4. Dashboard displays:
   - 2 projects (Residential Complex Nairobi, Commercial Tower Dar es Salaam)
   - 3 tasks (Foundation inspection, Electrical wiring, Site survey)
   - Dashboard statistics and charts
5. Navigation between dashboard sections works correctly

## Files Modified Summary
```
Frontend (TypeScript/React):
- src/lib/api/client.ts (Auth header format)
- src/lib/api/api.ts (Added authAPI)
- src/lib/api/services.ts (Fixed login params)
- src/app/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx (Type fixes)
- src/app/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx (Type fixes)
- src/app/system-status/page.tsx (Type fixes)

Backend (Python/Django):
- projects/management/commands/create_sample_data.py (Fixed notifications)

Database:
- Updated user associations and password
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete login flow in browser
2. Verify dashboard loads all sections correctly
3. Test navigation between different dashboard pages
4. Ensure error handling works for edge cases
5. Remove API test files before production
